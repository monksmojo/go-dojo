### GO PRACTICALS

> this repository contains list of programming exercises and problems i solve using GO

- The repo is just like a menu driven program where you can see the list of solved practical exercises in GO. 
- You can run the specific practical exercise from the main menu to see its execution.
- You can read the .md files in each of pn package to see practical exercise solution with description.
- For Example: pn1 package contains two files
   - pn_one.go (contains the source code for solving the practical exercise)
   - pn1.md (contains the practical exercise solution with description)
