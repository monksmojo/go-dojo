### GO PRACTICALS

> this repository contains list of programming exercises and problems i solve using GO

- The repo is just like a menu driven program where you can see the list of solved practical exercises in GO.
- You can run the specific practical exercise from the main menu to see its execution.
- You can read the .md files in each of pn package to see practical exercise solution with description.
- For Example: pn1 package contains two files
  - pn_one.go (contains the source code for solving the practical exercise)
  - pn1.md (contains the practical exercise solution with description)

### List Of Practical Exercises

1. PN :1 print all the prime numbers up to the given nTh integer
2. PN :2 reverse the element of the array using
   - reverse the array using the naive approach
   - reverse the array using two pointers approach
   - Reversing the slice in descending order using the built in function
3. PN :3 cost by day from video Go Programming – Golang Course with Bonus Projects 3:23:00
   - using make() function
   - using nested for loop
4. PN :4 2D matrix printing from video Go Programming – Golang Course with Bonus Projects 3:29:30
5. PN :5 Creating a name dictionary which holds names with its frequency Go Programming : Golang Course with Bonus Projects 4:05:22
6. PN :6 Take a slice and filter all the multiples of 3 and 5 from the slice
7. PN :7 Write a Go function to swap the consecutive characters in a string input by the user. For example input: “jackiechan”, output: “ajkceihcna”
8. Write a Go function to input 2 strings i.e. s1 and s2 and find the presence of s1 in s2.")
9. Write a Go function to remove the characters which have odd index values in a given string.")
10. Write a Go function to find frequency of each character of the string.")
11. Write a Go function to find the second largest element in the slice")
12. Write a Go function to convert a given string to all uppercase if it contains at least uppercase characters in the first 4 characters.")
13. Write a Go function to remove duplicate characters of a given string.")
14. Write a Go function to print the reverse of the string and check for palindrome")
15. Write a Go function to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string. Eg input: 'abc', 'xyz' output: 'xyc abz'")
