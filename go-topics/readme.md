#### how to access this repository

- Each topic mentioned above have a separate directory and module in the repository.

- Each module contains a markdown file with the same name.

```
for example:
|01main // directory contains
|--- go.mod
|--- main.go // playgroup executing the concept i have learned
|--- 01main.md // all the description of the topic example
|--- main_test.go // unit test for the concepts
```

- [golang_topics.md](./golang_topics.md) contains more general concepts and facts i found about go

- i have tried to follow test driven development (TDD) approach so you may find
`main_test.go`
