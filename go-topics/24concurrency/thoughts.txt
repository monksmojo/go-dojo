I am tired. 
I want to close my eyes
I want to shut down my mind to the outside world and for once
My insecurities have started to take a toll on me
I am bleak and weak mentally and physically
The nutFanMonster has started to take it's toll
My yellow fever is at it's peak
I have become the slave of media consuming my brain and mind has been somehow rewired to consume media all the time.
Rest assure these problems are acting as a roadblock in work, and personal life, for past one week i am not abel to focus on work neither i have abel to give achieve any deliverables.
for my self building, achieving goals 
like
changing job
leaving country
getting a good health
getting a good physique 
are all deep down the rabbit hole
i can't focus
i have watched enough dopamine detox tips, self helping tips, productivity hacks
but i am just consuming. I know all this info  but it's implementation is zero
All these thoughts are just vanishes at the back of my head
It seems like i am possessed
My thoughts and actions don't sync together  
i can take the help of the god, 
but the goal i have in my mind and the steps it needs to achieve it somehow may disrespect the religion 
or the way of the lord as per my religion
I have to find my own way to make a pact with the lord and have to resolve my tension with the god to get the blessing from him
somehow i am failing at that too.
I also think he has helped me too much i am too grateful to my parents and to the lord for what they have given me and i cannot ask for more.
But I need to move forward, i need to grow, i want to grow,
the goals,the fire,the fight has some how started to compromise to "It is what it is"
Fuck "what It is what it is" era I don't want to compromise, I will not compromise
